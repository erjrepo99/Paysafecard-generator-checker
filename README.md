# Paysafecard-generator-checker

Paysafecard Generator is a tool created for educational and testing purposes. This project demonstrates how a code generator works and is not intended to violate any laws or Paysafecardâ€™s terms of service. Using this tool for illegal purposes is strictly prohibited.

---

## **Features**
- Generates sample Paysafecard codes.  
- Automatically verifies generated codes on the official website.  
- Operates in a loop until a valid code is found.   

**Note:** This is a working version of the project, but it is still under development and not fully polished. We apologize for any issues or incomplete features.
Additionally, the program is currently only available in Polish. We are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause to non-Polish-speaking users, and we plan to improve this in the future.

## **Requirements**
- Python 3.8 or later.  
- A suitable development environment.

 ## **Tutorial: How to Run the Paysafecard Generator Project**
1. Install Python
First, make sure you have Python installed. If not, download it from python.org and install it, ensuring you check the option Add Python to PATH.

After installation, verify Python is working by running the following in your terminal:
python --version

2. Install Dependencies
Create a requirements.txt file in your project folder and add the following lines:

requests
beautifulsoup4
lxml

Install the dependencies with the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Alternatively, you can install them individually:

pip install lxml

3. Run the Program
After installing the dependencies, run your Python program:


python generator.py

If you use python3, use this command instead:
